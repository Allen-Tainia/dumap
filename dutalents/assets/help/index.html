  <h2>What's this?<h2>
      This program calculates DU talent points offline. It knows DU talents and their relationships.

      <h3>Quick-Start</h3>
      <h4>Overview</h4><img src="toolbar.png" width="946" height="113" alt="Toolbar" title="" />
      <ul>
        <li>Look at the top toolbar. It has three dialogs: Edit, Load and Save. Click each and lastly the "Edit". Also,
          point each item on toolbar to read their tooltip.</li>
        <li>Edit: This is the main screen. It actually edits talents.</li>
        <li>Save: After you have edited talents, switch to this screen and save your data.</li>
        <li>Load: In this dialog you can load talents back to editor.<br /></li>
        <li>On right side there is character selection box. By default there is only one character with name "char1".
          You can leave it as-is for now.</li>
        <li>The program starts at Edit page</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Editing talents</h4>
      <img src="group1.png" width="723" height="414" alt="First talent group" title="" />
      <ul>
        <li>First talent group is "Tools Manager" and it has four talents. Each talent has five checkboxes from level 1
          to level 5.</li>
        <li>Click the first checkbox next to 1200. Then click the next after "6k". See how at the end of the line sum
          went from 1200 to 7200. The tool sums up used skillpoints. The same sum is also added to the whole group.</li>
        <li>Click at the next "Maneuver Tool Optimization" first checkbox. Now first skill has 7200 and second has 1800
          points. The group has total 9k points.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <img src="group2.png" width="683" height="178" alt="total 9k points" title="" /></li>
      <ul>
        <li>The tool automatically uses condensed numbers. 9000 becomes 9K and 9000000 becomes 9M</li>
        <li>Now click third skill, <b>last</b> checkbox. It automatically selects lower levels</li>
        <li>See how last skill "opened". Click the <b>first</b> checkbox of third skill and the fourth gets again
          disabled.</li>
        <li>Click again the third skill, fifth checkbox. Then click fourth skill, fifth box. You should have now 2.4M as
          group total.</li>
        <li>Click again third skill, first box. See what happened to fourth skill? It got cleared and disabled. This
          happens because the fourth skill <b>depends</b> on the third skill.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Use dependencies</h4>
      <img src="dependencies.png" width="541" height="312" alt="Dependencies" title="" />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Make your browser window narrower and wider. Watch "Dependencies" stripe. It jumps either below or right of a
          group.
        </li>
        <li>Click the "Dependencies"of first group. It should open/close the panel and show <b>Enables skills</b>:
          Repair Tool
          Efficiency:4 ? Repair Tool Optimization. This means that when you click level 4 in "Repair Tool
          Efficiency" skill, then skill "Repair Tool Optimization" gets enabled. Set the skill to level 4 or 5. The last
          skill gets enabled and under "Dependencies" the skill dependency turned green.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Save your work</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Click on the toolbar "Save", and the page changes to save dialog. Just click the <b>Save</b> button. You
          will see a success message saying thet data is saved.</li>
        <li>Now close the tab or click "Back" at the right edge of the toolbar. Then navigate back to the editor. You
          should see again the editor and the skills as they were before closing.</li>
        <li>This is the basic loop: Open the editor, edit skills, switch to "Save" sand save.</li>

      </ul>
      <h3>Saving</h3>
      <h4>Save to browser's local storage</h4>
      <img src="save.png" width="493" height="617" alt="Saving" title="" />
      <p>By default the editor saves talents into local storage of the browser. Be warned: <b>Clearing your browser's
          cache
          might also remove content from local storage.</b> As long as the browser's data is not cleared, the local
        storage is a convenient place to save some data.</p>
      <p>Switch to the "Save" dialog. It has two fields: Key and Talent Data. The Key is a name used to store the data.
        Talent Data is a JSON string holding all charactes and their selected skills.</p>
      <p>The editor uses a default key "DUTalents". Use it, unless you want to save different copies.</p>
      <p>Click the <b>Save</b> button to actually save the data into browser's local storage.</p>
      <p> You can change the key to save another copy of the data. Think of it
        as a file name in a file system without any folders.</p>
      <h4>Save permanently outside browser</h4>
      <p>An alternative way to save is to click the <b>Copy to Clipboard</b> button. Afterwards open a text editor and
        paste the clipboard into the text editor and save it into file. Now you have a permanent copy of the talents
        outside the browser.</p>

      <h3>Loading</h3>
      <h4>Load from local storage</h4>
      <img src="load.png" width="591" height="740" alt="Loading" title="" />
      <p>The editor automatically tries to load talents when it starts from local storage with "DUTalents" key.</p>
      <p>You can also navigate to "Load" dialog to load saved skills. It sets the key to "DUTalents" by default. The
        dialog has read the default key from local storage when you switch to it. Click <b>Load Talents</b> to move the
        skills to editor, resetting whatever there was before. You can use this e.g. if playing with skills, selecting
        and unselecting. The load back a known state.</p>
      <p>If you have other copies in local store, change the Key to another value. Watch the message below it. It tells
        whether the key is in local storage. Click <b>Read</b> to fetch the value into dialog. Next click <b>Load
          talents</b> to load them to editor.</p>
      <p>If you don't remember the name of the key, click <b>Search</b> repeatedly. It searches data in local storage,
        which looks like talent data and fetches the value to dialog.</p>
      <p>You will probably find a key "DUTalentsAutoBackup". This is a copy of the data when you last time closed the
        editor, and every five minutes. Load it if something strange happened and you don't have any other save.</p>
      <p>You can repeatedly click <b>Search</b>. It starts from beginning after it can't find more saves.</p>
      <h4>Loading from clipboard.</h4>
      <p>If you have saved talents outside browser, copy the data to clipboard from e.g. text editor. Then select all
        text on Talent Data field and paste over from clipboard. Then click <b>Load
          talents</b> to load them to editor.</p>
      <h3>Navigating in editor</h3>
      <h4>Tiers</h4>
      <p>Each tier has it's own collapsible panel. Click the "Tier1" stripe at the top of the page. All the tier 1
        content is hidden. Click the "Tier2" to open it.</p>
      <p>You can have multiple tiers open at the same time. Higher tiers don't have yet any data, so they are disabled
        for now.</p>
      <p>You can also scroll to a tier by clicking a tier on right side summary panel.</p>
      <h4>Navigate through dependencies</h4>
      <img src="minerdependencies.png" width="471" height="307" alt="" title="" />
      <p>Open some dependency panels, e.g. Miner group. <h4></h4>Some of the dependencies unlock skills in another
        group. In this
        case Dredger group in tier 2 is dependent on skills in Miner group. In Miner group dependencies, click the
        "Dredger" word. The editor scrolls to dredger group. In there, click in its dependencies "Miner" to scroll back.
      </p>
      <p>The editor opens tiers when necessary. Because opening a tier takes some time, the scrolling is delayed a
        second, and first time might not land exactly to right place.</p>
      <h4>Navigate by role</h4>
      <p>Click the roles on right side summary panel. The editor jumps through all groups belonging to that role.</p>
      <p>At the end the program pause, but next click starts again from beginning. If you click another role, the
        program starts jumping its groups from the beginning.</p>
      <h3>Characters</h3>
      <h4>Edit and Add characters</h4>
      <img src="choosecharacter.png" width="492" height="359" alt="Edit Character" title="" />
      <p>Open the character selector on toolbar and select "Edit Characters". It opens character editor to
        add/edit/remove characters.
        <img src="editcharacter.png" width="569" height="339" alt="" title="" />
        <ul>
          <li>Click <b>Add</b> to add new character. Give a name to it.</li>
          <li>Click "pen" on each row to rename a character.</li>
          <li>Click "trashcan" to remove a character.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There has to be at least one character. Deleting the last one creates a default char1 immediately.</p>
        <p>Changes to characters are not saved until you save data in "Save" dialog.</p>
        <h4>Switch between characters</h4>
        <p>If you select another character from toolbar, the editor retains skills of previous character and loads the
          new character.</p>
