Map

- Need to fix the camera orientation
- Need more toggle options/sliders whatever
- Need to draw lines between two points
- Need info boxes for planets (info panel?)
- Need live data functionality


Auth

- Auth needs a real landing page and failure page
- Logout button?



Pack

- Need to modify pack.sh to take options like "prod" "public" etc, so that index.php isn't bundled


Service

- Need to actually write the passthrough service for the game data -> map (a separate repo will be made for this)
